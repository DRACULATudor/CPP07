# C++ Module 07 Overview

## Introduction

C++ Module 07 introduces advanced concepts in template programming, focusing on function templates, class templates, and their applications. This module enhances your understanding of generic programming in C++, enabling you to write more flexible and reusable code.

## Compilation

```
make
```
Or, if there is no Makefile:
```
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 *.cpp -o program
```
Run the program:
```
./exec_name(check Makefile)

```
# Usage
```
Run the compiled program to test basic C++ concepts, such as input/output handling, loops, and basic functions.
```
## Topics Covered

### 1. **Function Templates**
   - **Definition and Syntax**: Learn how to define function templates to create generic functions that can operate with different data types.
   - **Template Specialization**: Understand how to specialize templates for specific data types to optimize performance or handle special cases.

### 2. **Class Templates**
   - **Defining Class Templates**: Explore how to create class templates to design generic classes that can work with any data type.
   - **Member Function Templates**: Learn how to define member functions within class templates to provide flexible behavior.

### 3. **Iterators and Template Usage**
   - **Iterator Basics**: Understand the role of iterators in C++ and how they work with template classes like containers.
   - **Template Applications**: Apply templates in various scenarios, such as creating generic containers and algorithms.

## Usage

Execute the compiled program to explore advanced template concepts in C++, including function templates, class templates, and iterators. The program demonstrates how to create and use templates for various data types and operations.
